            Hello! Devin here! Just an up and coming developer showcasing what he can do. Coding, for me, is an artistic outlet, allowing me to creatively produce functional and fun tools for everyone! I decided to learn to code because as long as I can remember, I have had ideas and innovations bouncing around my head, but I lacked the skills to bring my thoughts into reality. Coding gives me that outlet! Unstopper the flow of creation!
